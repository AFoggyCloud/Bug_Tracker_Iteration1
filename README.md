# Bug_Tracker_Iteration1
Upload of the Bug Tracker that I have on my hard drive

This is my first real foray into what I, in my limited experience, would consider to be programming at a professional level. Kind of thinking along the lines of "what kind of projects would I see in an actual corporate environment?" First thing that came to mind was a bug tracker.
That said, the program isn't one that I made from scratch. I took inspiration from the design found here -> geeksforgeeks.org/bug-tracking-system
  -> However, I'm not as familiar with original C, and so I rewrote it in C++ since that's the language that I spent a lot of time with in college and am therefore much more comfortable. Yes, I know that they're very similar languages. It has just been my (again, limited) experience that C++ comes with a few more bells and whistles that I have come to enjoy. All that said, I do also plan on rewriting this in Python at some point.
  -> Did I mention I'm absolutely going to change things from the original design that, to put it bluntly, I don't like? Because I will change anything and everything if that makes it function in a way I find satisfactory.
